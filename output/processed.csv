Or, not exactly hard rock, but they were rocking it, it's fast pace and not classical. Good drummer, bass player, and then one guy on electric cello with pedals, another on violin with effects as well, and a fifth on violin. A really cool group. Reminds me a bit of the band 2CELLOS (ironically they are named similarly?) anyway bring them back for sure.",20

They also have a good set instruments; the drummer has a small full kit, they got mics, a funky keyboard player with special effects, a flute player who does tap dance, and a spoon player. All of them dressed up, shades, and a cigarette(fake?) here and there. Good entertainment!",14
Aldo Perez Trio,"10/8/16, 11:00 PM",psychoaldo@earthlink.net,"Jazzy dudes in suits with sunglasses. The drummer brought his own small full kit and played at a nice level (good thing he came early and it was no problem to leave his drums on the prior set). Special guests part of the show included a keyboardist, a nice woman singing with a great voice for jazz. She also played clarinet which completed the jazzy ambiance. Oh and another large singer, who was playing rhythm with spoons on some songs. And a bit of tap dancing by the same woman. They were quite fun! A good group to bring again.  N.b. Finished playing at 12:30, but to be fair I only managed to get them started 20mins late.",35

They just casually played their set, while the audience hanged out, some drinking, some dancing (mostly standing in the room). It was a different interaction than the last two bands, yet still seemed good. Interesting how 2-3 of them kept switching places between electric guitar, bass and acoustic guitar (and once drums).",

During his performance tonight he was wearing a dress of sorts, but with no underwear, which was unavoidably discovered through his set. At one point he was playing piano and sitting on the drum throne with his legs spread very wide (making unsavory contact with the chair that most of our bands use).

He also wanted some cloths to put in the kick, but didn’t have any on hand (the snare was the loudest piece though). But it was okay, I still got the vocals above the rest just fine.

Erin K,"7/2/16, 10:00 PM",erin.t.kron@gmail.com,"She had more voice than I expected! Some folk songs and she plays dynamically pretty well, going from very quiet, to lots of energy. I’m not sure if she sometimes was a bit out of tune, or if that was her way of playing with her voice, or part of the folk nature. Maybe the latter too. The crowd loved her.",22
Erin K,"8/6/16, 9:30 PM",erin.t.kron@gmail.com,"Erin is simple. Acoustic guitar and voice. Yet she packs powerful vocal cords, and plays songs with a lot of Dynamic range, going from soft to loud. Her lyrics are really fun too! Worth bringing her again.",21
Erin K,"7/15/17, 10:00 PM",erin.t.kron@gmail.com,"Erin has a fabulous voice, and a knack for telling emotional relationship stories in her songs. She can play surprisingly softly, slow down her tempo, and pick up pace again. She is great.",24
Erin K,"1/6/18, 8:00 PM",erin.t.kron@gmail.com,Erin has a very poignant voice and sings some nice and sweet songs on her acoustic guitar. It was nice and I think it caught a few people'a attention. Iriving was live recording on this one.,17

A lot of instrumentation going on, drummer (with full kit and digital drum pads), percussionist, three keyboards, bass, electric guitar, and 3 vocals (though one lead mostly). I think they are fine. Some interesting sounds going on, hence the complex instrumentation, but I'd say it wasn't out of this world. I wonder how they sound in a bigger/different space.

The band sounds pretty cool, a girl on cajun with a kind of conga drum electric guitar and bass to back it up and a guy on lead singing with a sweet voice. The whole thing was pretty rhythmical and cool, just a little hard to hear them through the loud party people talking and drinking (good turn out I guess though).

He had a harmonica mike and a small amp for it (hadn't seen that the last time I did sound for him) it adds a cool sound. Also, he even used that 2nd mike as a extra delay or effect to his vocal, though sparingly. Very clever use.",1

Heartbreak Karaoke,"2/10/17, 5:00 PM",facultylounge2@gmail.com,"15?  Popular tonight but Jesus these are the neediest people I've ever met. A question every five minutes, I swear to god. They asked me to come pass the tip bucket for them. There are FOUR of you and I'm making four sandwiches, do it yourself! I just don't think this is an early evening event. This isn't Korea; we sing karaoke when we're drunk, and anyone who's drunk at 5:30 has bigger things on their mind. The organizers also treat people who don't want to participate with contempt. ""Alright, so they're all too cool for school."" Or maybe they don't want to interrupt their conversation to sing shitty pop songs at 6:30? Maybe they had other plans that didn't involve you? More power to people trying to start something here, but this fills the bar with annoying music from 6-8. Two different people just thought that it was a really crappy cover band. Anyway... Conclusion: Whatever.  Also: chill out!",

A good group of friends who got together to sing some Christmas songs that sound decent (not like in the shopping mall). Guitar, keyboard, double bass, soft drums, saxophone, and two girls who alternatively came one at a time to sing with the guy (who had a very nice voice by the way).",30
Hunter and Wolfe,"2/24/18, 10:00 PM",hunterandwolfe@gmail.com,"Nice duo. The lead is jamming hard on the guitar, while the electric guitar accompanies him with some higher notes and melodies. A guest singer here and there. The guests were okay, but the duo was good.",26
Hunter and Wolfe,"6/16/18, 9:00 PM",hunterandwolfe@gmail.com,"2 Neat little duo and good pair between the acoustic and electric guitar (plus one warm vocal). They played a few covers, seemed to be a fun jamming session but well done. They got a good punch to their play style. Great.",13
Hunter and Wolfe,"12/15/18, 10:00 PM",hunterandwolfe@gmail.com,"7+1 Christmas special!! Yeah! Big group too. Five of them were players, one guy main singer, and a girl singing too. There was also a guy in charge of “bells” and other chimes who was comically just sitting on the side as if part of the audience, occasionally pulling some bells out of a bag. Christmasy songs and a classy feeling (mainly from the lead singer being in a suit) it was good. A pretty decent crowd so probably good to have them again. Can they do more than just Christmas?",33

A guy had a keyboard hooked to a laptop, then drummer, double bass and electric guitarist, while the lead was singing and playing acoustic guitar. The sixth member of the group was a girl singing backup vocal. Put all that together and it's good. They had a short set but that worked well with the timing of things tonight.",20

Ira Wolf,"4/28/18, 9:00 PM",irawolfmusic@gmail.com,1 Ira has a fabulous voice. She has a small guitar (half size?) yet it has a nice tone and goes well with her voice…. maybe it’s her finger picking. Stephanie from before joined her on Banjo for a couple of songs. Very charming and captivating music. So Ira and the two previous groups knew each other. I think the crowd was just slowly growing up to the point of Ira playing (meaning the same people that came for the first band (lee) stayed up till Ira played).,27
Isaac Gillespie,"6/11/16, 10:00 PM",isaac.gillespie@gmail.com,"Funky! The last band had a short set so he started earlier and jammed with Yaman who was playing after him.

J. Allen,"8/13/16, 8:00 PM",mailbag@jallenmusic.com,"The first word that comes to my mind is melancholy, because of how Allen uses his voice.

A good sounding voice for this high energy group, which doesn't need much reverb. Too bad they didn't attract much people this time. They are traveling from Utica.",9

The guy on electric guitar is fancy with 8 strings and special rifts. I'm not sure about the acoustic on lead, doesn't feel like it goes entirely with the rest of the rock, but like I said, that was from my first impression, after half way through they sounded like some decent hard rock. Also an occasional harmonica! Plus, people liked them too and thought they sounded great. Also, I think they had a backup drummer, and normally are four instead of three. So good job.",18

They sound amazing and are wildly entertaining (I guess having wireless pickup mics on both bass players helps, as they can walk through the room with ease). The sax player is cool, the double bass kicks ass and the lead singer got a good voice for this. And the drums blend seamlessly in the background. Book them again ASAP!",35

Lauren Lee,"5/12/18, 11:00 PM",info@laurenleeprojectjazz.com,"2 Interesting but just okay. Some abstract (improvised?) instrumentals, but somehow doesn't feel complete to me... or not well in harmony (unless that's what they are going for). There's a guy with a small synth with a lot of complex sounds and beats. And a girl on a nord keyboard, with a mic, not really singing, but doing more atmospheric singing with her voice. She seems a bit more about the tonal qualities of sounds while the guy is more about cool frequencies? But it feels to me as if they don't fully match together. Also i think it might be improved jamming. Started okay but crowd slowly went down, leaving the last 15mins with 2 women who probably came just to see them.",8

I liked the old guy playing the electric saw. That added some interesting sounds to this already multilayered group. They had two electric guitars on top of the acoustic played by the lead singer. So, the “multilayered” aspect I am talking about was “busy” sound… I think the guitarists were each doing something special and it was just hard to get a good mix.",20

Either way, special). He's got a small Roland keyboard hooked to the fender blues. With the drummer and guitarist on back up vocal it sounds great. Also a bass player with fancy hair. Oh and he had a saxophone that he pulled out at the climax moment late in the set. Nice filled room.",35

Patrick Sargeant,"9/8/18, 10:00 PM",jfatum@gmail.com,"2 Patrick + double bass player. Awesome. Patrick had a some drum samples, alternated on an acoustic guitar and keys, and finally, his saxophone. A well-played good sounding set. Fun fact: Patrick can even play keys and Saxophone at the same time! Too bad tonight seemed low for music though.",8

Patrick Sargent,"2/17/18, 11:00 PM",patricksargent7@gmail.com,"Interesting. Patrick has a nice soft voice paired with some high energy music. He has a small synth on a strap and for the climax of a song pulled out his saxophone. Overall they have good rhythm and some interesting songs.

A loud group though for Pete's small music room, on the limit of being way too loud (I think the loudness might have been mainly coming from one dude on electric guitar with heavy effects). I really wish they were a tad lower, it would be more enjoyable cuz otherwise they got good music... and they did have a few peeps staying (but probably also some skipping the room cuz it was too loud).",12

Also, Sarah and Willis will be more clear with the directors that the plays need to end at a specific time, and if they don't, we will interrupt and end the show. That being said. The room was full.

Quixote Project,"3/31/18, 8:00 PM",thequixoteproject@yahoo.com,"5 Nice full band with two kick drums! (Cuz they have a drummer and the lead singer/acoustic guitar also has one). They are pretty rhythmical and high tempo with some tambourines as well. It would sound purely like bluegrass except they also have a keyboard player so it's more diverse. Their first time here, yet pretty decently good. Could be booked again next time they are in town.",19

I think most of what they played was drawn from a composer? (Hence tribute). Either way unique stuff. Double bass player, clarinet, electric guitar, and a drummer. Good dynamics, clarinet solos and sometimes the guitar playing in harmony with the clarinet. Few people were cheering. I'd invite them again, special.",20

Went okay for their first time here.",14

The girl sings with a super emotional whisper (and she looks pretty) while the guy on guitar plays some fancy tricks. He also was hooked to two amps to add some drone effect from time to time. It sounded dope. They had a drummer with them too, so that added some good beats to the already amazing sound. They are special, get them back.",24
Slow Dance,"8/4/18, 10:00 PM",justinnlacy@gmail.com,"2	 A sexy voice and an aggressive classical guitar. Although sometimes the guitar is played quietly (finger style), accompanying the girl's singing.

The lead singer brought his sister on stage to sing two songs and that was good. Good energy throughout the night!",30
The Academics,"7/29/17, 10:00 PM",theacademicsmusic@gmail.com,"The academics are an interesting band. I like how they alternate singers btw the electric guitar player, the bass player, and the main guy on acoustic guitar. I think it depends which one of them wrote the song?More on the loud side. The lead really has a lot of energy to give, which is funny cuz the bass player looks like a shy girl.

The Icebergs,"4/24/18, 8:30 PM",jane@janelecroy.com tom@northern-spy.com,3 Cool 3 piece. Female vocals with drums and cello backing. Cello acted as bass/guitar playing chords and bass lines. Felt original without being too much. Cool sound with great vocals. Pop but not? Funky and soulful. Parts were mainstream. Other parts were jazz with a sort of singing poetry over top.  I’m terrible at describing music. Reminded me of Violent femmes but sounded nothing like them?,6

Not in a bad way, but that's almost the adjective I'd use for this kind of rock, the mood, the way he uses his voice and the power in their rhythmical patterns.

Nord player, drummer, and the lead on guitar with his own amp, occasionally doing some controlled feedback with it. They seem good at what they do and they got a nice amount of people here. Yay.",30

The cymbals were a bit too much on some parts, he asked me at the end what i thought and so he did notice a little. Otherwise good music. -Not sure what happened there.

He wanted a specific reverb, I like that (some kind of slap, went with reverb+delay). He couldn't wait to play, cuz he said some fans were only here for short time, so he started at 9:05 kinda. Also he only had 9 songs and so he finished before 9:30... I think he said he plays with a band, but they play less so he just started trying to do solo gigs, hence the short set. I guess bad timing for tonight since it left a gap.l until the 10:30 set. Otherwise he sounds fine, indeed he had a few fans, and then he hung out at the bar for a while.",12

Yazan,"4/4/16, 10:30 PM",yazan@shouldertap.com,Interesting old delta blues style on an old Gibson L5 that he converted to left handed guitar playing which made me shutter when I saw it- he had an enjoyable set though and had a cool vibe. The first show for his april residency. He and his friends stayed til close. They were all quite nice and relaxed. Probably high. Easy to have him play the late slot on Mondays as he was solo acoustic.,15

The whole set felt like a story (which had a narrative voice at times) talking about a deep interaction between humans, planet, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Performative as well. At one point two members where blindfolded while interacting on an electronic device. Payton, the man on vocals, was pretty good, mostly singing long notes, yet at one part of the set, mimicking the sound of the electronics quite accurately with his voice. The second set was handled as a continuation of the first. Throughout the four performers alternated their parts, yet David and Melissa were the two main players. The whole thing felt meditative and fascinating to watch, and hear. Good supporting crowd too.",25
