"2Birds Band";"11/17/18, 11:00 PM";"tonybirdviolin@gmail.com";"tonybirdviolin@gmail.com   20 5 Hard rock string group! Very very high energy, and high rhythm! Or, not exactly hard rock, but they were rocking it, it's fast pace and not classical. Good drummer, bass player, and then one guy on electric cello with pedals, another on violin with effects as well, and a fifth on violin. A really cool group. Reminds me a bit of the band 2CELLOS (ironically they are named similarly?) anyway bring them back for sure."

Special guests part of the show included a keyboardist, a nice woman singing with a great voice for jazz. She also played clarinet which completed the jazzy ambiance. Oh and another large singer, who was playing rhythm with spoons on some songs. And a bit of tap dancing by the same woman. They were quite fun! A good group to bring again.  N.b. Finished playing at 12:30, but to be fair I only managed to get them started 20mins late."

He has an acute vocal and a cool sound. I liked his lyrics too. His drummer toned the fender blues for him… not 100% sold on the sound of the electric guitar though, some songs it worked, some I felt it was a bit muddy or dull… maybe it’s also a combination with his guitar, not sure. But overall still good. Sharp was his sound and his looks in a red suit."

The lead of this group really moved like that, good player. On the edge of too loud for me though, as it really is hard play, and his amp+guitar feels a bit like screeching to me. But they are good at what they do. The voice also matches the style."

"Björn’s Birthday Blowout";"10/13/18, 10:00 PM";"breathbeat@gmail.com";"breathbeat@gmail.com   25 2 Surprise birthday/set for Bjorn. Turned out good. About 25 standing people. Bjorn was touched, people were cheering, and he sang a few songs unprepared to his backing track, accompanied by Rob on violin. It sounded good. Took him a few mins at the beginning to gather the tracks/lyrics (it was a surprise to him that he was playing) so it ended up being a 30mins set, which i think was fine since it led to a nice animated room."

During his performance tonight he was wearing a dress of sorts, but with no underwear, which was unavoidably discovered through his set. At one point he was playing piano and sitting on the drum throne with his legs spread very wide (making unsavory contact with the chair that most of our bands use). Would not recommend another performance. Also the music is rather coarse and extremely lengthy."

The bass player is in charge of some backing tracks, and there’s an electric guitar player. I think they were partially celebrating a birthday? Ah yes, an extended booking with Jake. So they played two sets with a little break in between. They sound good and jazzy. The crowd is busy entertaining themselves and talking a bit, so slightly harder to hear everything but people were having a good time."

Girl on vocal and acoustic, and a guy on violin and backup vocal. I like the violin, and her voice is nice too, but the guitar seemed not to match the rest in tonality... sometimes. It was fine actually, I might be critical and just wish it sounded a bit different. Otherwise good set overall, they got some people too."

They were wonderful as a band, and plus they had guest singers. The energy was high! (So the +1 in my count is the occasional guest singers, but also the saxophone player, who seemed to have also played an occasional part). Successful! "

I just felt something was a little dry, or needed other instruments. He did say he has a band normally, but it might be too big to fit in Pete's. "

Also not sure how much vocal is on the track, there's at least some chorus... anyway she is singing on top so it's fine. Music was fine, people came to support, great."

Paired with Ana on mandolin (and sometimes violin, though she is still learning) overall yielded to some decent music, and the fans who came to hear them enjoyed it. Good amount of people in the room cheerful for them. P.s. Just mentioning Mike & Ana showed up at 20:05, so since I was worried I had let Vic continue to play a song or two...

"Great Woods";"8/12/17, 9:00 PM";"greatwoodsband@gmail.com";"greatwoodsband@gmail.com   14  Great Woods. Great. He has some good songs and puts the right energy into them. It's also interesting how he sometimes has a different person accompanying him. This time it was another dude on acoustic guitar... just for three songs, but they made a good duo. It's also funny how the room was empty before he started and as soon as he started playing various people came in."

He got some slower sounding songs on it, and it's a good mix. He uses his voice/Mike interestingly; close or off Mike, depending on how loud he sings, which diversifies his songs. But overall, he's got a special vocal sound, the one of Great Woods."

A question every five minutes, I swear to god. They asked me to come pass the tip bucket for them. There are FOUR of you and I'm making four sandwiches, do it yourself! I just don't think this is an early evening event. This isn't Korea; we sing karaoke when we're drunk, and anyone who's drunk at 5:30 has bigger things on their mind. The organizers also treat people who don't want to participate with contempt. ""Alright, so they're all too cool for school."" Or maybe they don't want to interrupt their conversation to sing shitty pop songs at 6:30? Maybe they had other plans that didn't involve you? More power to people trying to start something here, but this fills the bar with annoying music from 6-8. Two different people just thought that it was a really crappy cover band. Anyway... Conclusion: Whatever.  Also: chill out!"

Five of them were players, one guy main singer, and a girl singing too. There was also a guy in charge of “bells” and other chimes who was comically just sitting on the side as if part of the audience, occasionally pulling some bells out of a bag. Christmasy songs and a classy feeling (mainly from the lead singer being in a suit) it was good. A pretty decent crowd so probably good to have them again. Can they do more than just Christmas?"

A guy had a keyboard hooked to a laptop, then drummer, double bass and electric guitarist, while the lead was singing and playing acoustic guitar. The sixth member of the group was a girl singing backup vocal. Put all that together and it's good. They had a short set but that worked well with the timing of things tonight. "

She has a small guitar (half size?) yet it has a nice tone and goes well with her voice…. maybe it’s her finger picking. Stephanie from before joined her on Banjo for a couple of songs. Very charming and captivating music. So Ira and the two previous groups knew each other. I think the crowd was just slowly growing up to the point of Ira playing (meaning the same people that came for the first band (lee) stayed up till Ira played)."

The last band had a short set so he started earlier and jammed with Yaman who was playing after him. He got up from stage and fooled around in the middle twice. This energy reminded me a bit of Vic Thrill, but different style. Pretty entertaining and good mood music. Would have him again."

A good sounding voice for this high energy group, which doesn't need much reverb. Too bad they didn't attract much people this time. They are traveling from Utica."

Maybe the previous crowd, not sure... We did end the night at 12:30, which was mostly shifted from the beginning ~15-20mins."

Well, one guy has an electric guitar and the second an acoustic but with a few pedals. So, I'm not sure if it's really a special acoustic show, but I don't mind, they still sound interesting. The lead on vocal has a good voice. He mainly leads the dance with the acoustic guitar, while his partner plays lush notes. A song or two were solo for the lead. Overall this duo has a nice sound. Also, didn't realize they started early, since the 10pm finished early, but they were good, and the lead played 2-3 extra covers, so didn't finish that early. Real trooper. "

The guy on electric guitar is fancy with 8 strings and special rifts. I'm not sure about the acoustic on lead, doesn't feel like it goes entirely with the rest of the rock, but like I said, that was from my first impression, after half way through they sounded like some decent hard rock. Also an occasional harmonica! Plus, people liked them too and thought they sounded great. Also, I think they had a backup drummer, and normally are four instead of three. So good job."

She played her set as one whole piece, evolving and changing over time (though I think it was actual songs, she just kept going and didn’t stop, transitioning smoothly). She generates some captivating loops with her cello and then enchants the audience with her singing. Part instrumental, her vocal is only occasionally there. She also has a sampler with a few pre-recorded parts she probably done herself. Magical."

Some abstract (improvised?) instrumentals, but somehow doesn't feel complete to me... or not well in harmony (unless that's what they are going for). There's a guy with a small synth with a lot of complex sounds and beats. And a girl on a nord keyboard, with a mic, not really singing, but doing more atmospheric singing with her voice. She seems a bit more about the tonal qualities of sounds while the guy is more about cool frequencies? But it feels to me as if they don't fully match together. Also i think it might be improved jamming. Started okay but crowd slowly went down, leaving the last 15mins with 2 women who probably came just to see them."

"Pablo Galesi";"11/5/16, 8:00 PM";"cpgalesi@yahoo.com";"cpgalesi@yahoo.com  20 Vic ended at 20:05 so I only managed to get this six piece band started at 20:20. But they sounded alright. I liked the old guy playing the electric saw. That added some interesting sounds to this already multilayered group. They had two electric guitars on top of the acoustic played by the lead singer. So, the “multilayered” aspect I am talking about was “busy” sound… I think the guitarists were each doing something special and it was just hard to get a good mix."

The voice is the main part of the nice folk songs, while the other instruments blend together yet still distinctively heard. I also think the violinist was good with occasional long stretched notes, good with the mood of the songs. Would be nice to have them again."

"Phantom Wave";"8/18/18, 11:00 PM";"rachelafischer@gmail.com";"rachelafischer@gmail.com    12 4 Very noisy rock band indeed. They are not bad, some interesting sound waves with a ""phantom"" feel, as their name suggests. A loud group though for Pete's small music room, on the limit of being way too loud (I think the loudness might have been mainly coming from one dude on electric guitar with heavy effects). I really wish they were a tad lower, it would be more enjoyable cuz otherwise they got good music... and they did have a few peeps staying (but probably also some skipping the room cuz it was too loud)."

But we learned a lesson tonight- if an event cuts into someone else's performance, well just cut them off. Also, Sarah and Willis will be more clear with the directors that the plays need to end at a specific time, and if they don't, we will interrupt and end the show. That being said. The room was full.

Also was dressed in normal clothes for sound heck and then came out in a bathrobe and headband. Played jungle sounds on iPod while hammering 'pre show'. But, good songs once the weird stuff was done."

Generally unfortunate. No draw and I'm pretty sure it was that way last time too. It would be appreciated if he wasn't booked anymore- at least on Sunday's."

(Cuz they have a drummer and the lead singer/acoustic guitar also has one). They are pretty rhythmical and high tempo with some tambourines as well. It would sound purely like bluegrass except they also have a keyboard player so it's more diverse. Their first time here, yet pretty decently good. Could be booked again next time they are in town."

Although the other players were good too and interesting. The guy on electric guitar was actually also a main part, or perhaps because his volume was louder (but he did have solos). Worked with them to try to try to keep the girl’s voice above the mix as they wanted. They had some fans who came for them. So I think their turn out was good."

But Jake, our new afternoon sound guy, is aware of it and, I think, will help keep Vic on time. Very harmonious duo. Well it was mostly the girl, but the guy provided good support and they sounded beautiful. She had some extensive vocal loops which pushed the limit of how much sounds can happen in this room... Made it work by EQing live a bit."

The lead really has a lot of energy to give, which is funny cuz the bass player looks like a shy girl. I think the bass guitar battery ran out at some point, but they pulled through and kept playing.

They alternate who sings, they give each other solos, it’s actually pretty good. It’s jazzy and good! They’d love the play again and I say, sure why not."

Cello acted as bass/guitar playing chords and bass lines. Felt original without being too much. Cool sound with great vocals. Pop but not? Funky and soulful. Parts were mainstream. Other parts were jazz with a sort of singing poetry over top.  I’m terrible at describing music. Reminded me of Violent femmes but sounded nothing like them?"

Not in a bad way, but that's almost the adjective I'd use for this kind of rock, the mood, the way he uses his voice and the power in their rhythmical patterns. They had a drum machine that was also their ""metronome"" so they wanted it cranked up in the monitor... heavy thumps, but I guess it gives it character? Nord player, drummer, and the lead on guitar with his own amp, occasionally doing some controlled feedback with it. They seem good at what they do and they got a nice amount of people here. Yay. "

They sound good, their music is diverse, some slower songs with less instrumentation and some with more energy. The bass player occasionally plays the sax! They had a guest singer (girl with a very nice voice) for a song or two. They seem to have brought people too! Cool new bunch."
"The Quiet Is Kept";"12/8/18, 11:00 PM";"medecineman1@gmail.com";"medecineman1@gmail.com     18 5+1 Cool and chill. The lead is either singing only, or also on guitar. There’s a guy on bass or saxophone, a nice drummer, another guitar player, and this time a backup vocal (the fifth member). +1 is a guest singer, Taylor, a girl with a sweet voice… just for a song or two but a nice addition. One or two songs are more ambient-like, with a backing track and saxophone… it’s all about the vibe, and playing it cool."

The lead singer has a nice clear voice and sometimes yells with it (which suits the hard rock style that got). And the dude with dual keyboard has some cool sounds. They have some interesting up and downs in their songs. Even though it sounds cool and good, it's worth noting their songs are pretty long. I think they said this was their first time playing in Brooklyn? Quite interesting indeed."

A synth, drum machines and a computer (we had to grab a folding table for their setup, but it was worth it)... some consistent electronic rhythms, some sound effects and crazy vocal acting. Not to forget he has his own effect for vocal. I say acting because he really moves and sings... Words? Sometimes. He even walked through the room once. A pretty fun electronic performance."

And with the Korg keyboard in the mix it yields to some neat melodies. They had a girl to sing just two or three songs, and she had a nice voice, wish she sang more. The lead singer is okay, I just had to pump his monitor and thus had to cut back on some of the reverb for him."

Walker sounds good too, playing acoustic guitar, or their portable miked Cajun (which sometimes Colin also used). Colin also had a synth, which was used sparingly hence why the songs were simple yet pretty cool in artistry and emotion."

He wanted a specific reverb, I like that (some kind of slap, went with reverb+delay). He couldn't wait to play, cuz he said some fans were only here for short time, so he started at 9:05 kinda. Also he only had 9 songs and so he finished before 9:30... I think he said he plays with a band, but they play less so he just started trying to do solo gigs, hence the short set. I guess bad timing for tonight since it left a gap.l until the 10:30 set. Otherwise he sounds fine, indeed he had a few fans, and then he hung out at the bar for a while."

The whole set felt like a story (which had a narrative voice at times) talking about a deep interaction between humans, planet, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Performative as well. At one point two members where blindfolded while interacting on an electronic device. Payton, the man on vocals, was pretty good, mostly singing long notes, yet at one part of the set, mimicking the sound of the electronics quite accurately with his voice. The second set was handled as a continuation of the first. Throughout the four performers alternated their parts, yet David and Melissa were the two main players. The whole thing felt meditative and fascinating to watch, and hear. Good supporting crowd too."

He sounds really cool with some special delays for his vocal and loops, sometimes on his guitar as well. He has an old rhythm composer and blends everything together well to create a unique experience. Short set but sweet stuff."
